## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

There was not much of a challenge, everything went quite smoothly and it was a fun puzzle-like experience decoding each
document and its password. The most challenging part was probably destructuring as that is something I've never done
before, so it did take me a little bit to get the hang of that.
